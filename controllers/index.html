<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    For eleven years the PHP track at the <a href="https://www.froscon.de/1/home/">Free and Open Source Software Conference (FrOSCon)</a>
    was organized by the PHP UG of dortmund. Special thanks goes to Kore and Sebastian for their impressive work.
    From this year on <a href="https://twitter.com/electricmaxxx">Maximilian</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dot_ute">Ute</a> will take over.
</p>
<p>
    As last year we want to nerd out in our room. We want you to propose talks on nerdy,
    crazy stuff you did with PHP. Not the common conference talk, but let us hear about the crazy
    shit you are not supposed to tell anyone. Wrote a distributed raytracer, which generates
    images based on cosmic radiation only using functional paradigms in PHP?
    You are right on, <a href="/?page=cfp">propose your talk now</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Note that unless we find a sponsor for this, we won't be able to cover your travel expenses.
    This is an almost free conference organized by volunteers. We do not get any money for doing this,
    it just costs us time. But promised, we gonna have a lot of fun.
</p>
<h3 id="audience">The audience</h3>
<p>
    FrOSCon is a conference organized by geeks for geeks. One of the awesome things about FrOSCon is,
    that you will not only meet software developers, but also hardware geeks, telephony geeks, knitting geeks,
    gaming geeks. Prepare for that. :)
</p>
<p>
    Since this is the case you can come up with rather esoteric and complex topics you would not present elsewhere.
</p>
<h3 id="coc">Code Of Conduct</h3>
<p>
    Just like the FrOSCon has its <a href="https://www.froscon.de/1/faq/coc/">Code of Conduct</a>,
    a Code of Conduct also applies to the PHP room:
</p>
<blockquote>
    “Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
    regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
    physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
    We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
    Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops,
    parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be
    sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.”
</blockquote>
